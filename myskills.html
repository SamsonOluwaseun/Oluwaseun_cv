                <p>As a core statistician, I can say R is my first programming language because it brings statistical theory to live. I have more the 10 years experience coding in R while still improving myself. The simplicity of its sytax and availability
                    of resource community makes my use of R very smoot. I can say I have not seen any analytics problem that R cannot handl (I stand to be challenged). <br> <strong>Rating:</strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

                <p> On SQL I can say my journey as a Business analyst have been great because of my knowledge in SQL. Deploying analytics project in two majour financial institution in Nigeria really improved my skills on this, while I always learn trying
                    to catch-up with updates. It is on of the tools I find so confortable to use in creating procedures, data praparation for BI reports etc.<br>

                <p>I started using Python 5years ago mainly for data Science projects. I have undergon training on stock market predictive analysis with Python, using libraries such as Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib etc. Sometimes I prefer python for
                    data wrangling activities because of it syntax as seen in list comprehension, Piping, web scraping libraries and its capacity to integrate well with applications.<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐

                <p>My knowledge with powerbi is as deep as automating a financial institution monthly report such that it is updated and rendered to all stake holders on a daily basis. This lead to about 50% increase in the rate of decision making and call
                    to action. <br><strong>Rating:</strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
                </p>
                <p>Havent said all there are other programing languages and tools that I have built capacitiy on over the years platforms such as Visual studio (which was used in designing this website), Microsoft Power platform, google platforms and languages
                    such as HTML, PHP, .Net, X++, C# etc. Like I always say,
                    <strong><em>I am in programming fields because here is where what so ever you can think of is possible all you need is time to learn and experiment.</em></strong>
